# Applying to become a City Ambassador

In order to be considered for the role of a city ambassador you must fill out the application form available here: https://forms.gle/YEFoDXRt3VbM2dha7

The form will be reviewed by the ambassador program leads who will determine whether you will move to the next step of the process. If you are moved to the next step, you will then be contacted for an interview within two weeks of submitting your application. You will be informed of whether you were selected or not within a week of the interview.

As this is an organization representing women and underrepresented groups, we strongly prefer to have a representative from such a community in this position (unless there is a valid exception), hence we are only accepting Women with Pakistani background for this role.
