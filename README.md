# Definition of a City Ambassador
A city ambassador represents Pakistani Women in Computing (PWiC) and propagates our core values of learning, connecting and growing within their city. Ambassadors will use their passion for technology and their drive to create an impact in their community.

The PWiC City Ambassador Program is designed to increase participation, recruit future team members and expand our network and visibility. PWiC is a young but rapidly-growing organization and ambassadors can play a crucial role in shaping its future.

# PWiC City Ambassador Guidelines

This is a repository to detail the role of city ambassadors in the PWiC organization. 

## Why do we need these guidelines?

Here are some of the reasons we need this handbook:
1. We need a scalable way where we can build on top of each other with the least effort and overhead when starting as an ambassador
2. We take help from existing communities and material wherever we can (without reinventing the wheel every time) - for operations, organization etc
3. We are aligned in the overall direction and vision when it comes to appointing our ambassadors - with small deviances in how we operate locally given the social dynamics of the locality
4. We establish performance metrics for ambassadors
5. We build an active support system and know who to ask for help and guidance
